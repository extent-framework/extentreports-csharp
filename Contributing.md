# Reporting a Bug

The way you report a bug is the most critical part for a quick resolution. Bugs which lack clear description and steps to reproduce are often not fixed. If you find a bug please make sure that you log the bug based on the template below. Make sure that you are as descriptive as possible.

## Bug Template

### Title: Line of text which summarizes what the bug is about. (Max 70 characters)

- Be short and precise
- Use simple language and grammar
- Summarize what the issue is and nothing else

### Description: Describe the issue in a few lines using simple words

While describing a bug consider that you are describing it to someone who knows nothing about your problem. Be as elaborate as possible but avoid being verbose. Being verbose here would mean.
- Providing unnecessary details without which the bug can still be described.

In most of the cases, try to understand the bug in such a way that you can separate program can be written just to reproduce the issue. If you are not able to understand the bug at this moment, just try to recreate the problem with simplest possible code.

### Things to include in the Description
- What went wrong? for e.g. Adding a long description to a test results in truncation of the text.
- When it went wrong? for e.g. If you add a text description which is greater than 255 characters, the description text gets truncated

Things to NOT include in the Description
- You application specific details. For example, do not give elaborate background on what your application does.
- Talking about functions/code which is very specific to your project. We would not know about that.

### Steps to Reproduce:
- Detailed and precise steps to reproduce the bugs.
- Make sure that preconditions are specified. For e.g. include a particular library or tool which is necessary to reproduce the scenario.
- If possible you can attach images with annotations explaining where the problem is.
- If possible create a piece of code which can reproduce the issue without having any of your application/framework code.

### Expected Results
In the end make sure that you clearly explain what were you expecting. Being very clear here is the key.
